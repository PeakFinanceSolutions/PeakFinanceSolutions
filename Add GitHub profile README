## 🚀 What I’m building

I’m the founder of Peak Finance Solutions and builder of **70Lives App**, a SaaS platform designed to help **beauty professionals** manage their finances with clarity and confidence — without needing traditional accounting software.

The product is built from the ground up by someone who:
- works daily with sole traders & small businesses
- understands tax, VAT, and compliance (especially in Ireland & the EU)
- saw first-hand that existing tools were overkill or poorly suited

## 💡 Current focus
- 📊 Expense & income tracking for beauty pros
- 🧾 Smart receipt scanning (OCR)
- 🎙️ Voice-to-expense/sale logging
- 💶 VAT & tax-ready categorisation
- 📈 Pricing & profitability calculators

(*Core product repositories are private.*)

## 🛠 Tech I work with
- React & modern JavaScript
- Serverless cloud functions (Node.js)
- Stripe subscriptions & billing portals
- Managed cloud services (Firebase)
- OCR & data extraction pipelines
- IndexedDB-based offline storage

---

## 🎯 Background
